This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Tic-Tac-Toe

This is was primarily a reactproject implementing tic-tac-toe following along with the react tutorial found at [Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial).

### It features implementations of
- useState to manage the game board state
- A JavaScript Map object to store rendering configuration for each game cell
- The history of each move, stored in state as a board configuration
- Map keys ordered by row and column in an alphanumeric a1, a2, a3... b3...-> n fashion.
- The game board's rows and columns can be specified when it's component is called, up to "K" rows (10).
- CSS classes toggle basic "toggle" render state
- CSS defines grid rendering logic --- //to do, CSS configurations


## Key goals while developing
- Familiarize myself with—and practic—React
- Set up and prototype my first Next.js web-app project
- Practice refactoring sourced code into more extensible, reusable, and unique code
- Practice programming techniques such as utilizing bit shifting, using Javascript Maps.
- Practice styling using CSS grid, adopting and extending "boilplate" CSS to fit the needs of the project
- Theorizing how I can decouple domains in the code--> styling from game logic, player state from board state.
