# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Next.js

***This is a Next.js project, bootstrapped with create-next-app. It’s an extended version of React’s Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial, with additional features and customizations. You can check it out at https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe but do note that there are major differences between this project and that tutorial***

## Features

  - Game State Management: useState to manage board, move history, and player turns.
  - Map-Based Cell Configuration: Uses a JavaScript Map for each cell’s state, organized in an alphanumeric grid format (e.g., a1, b2).
  - Dynamic Board Size: Allows up to a 10x10 grid (up to "K" rows).
  - CSS-Based Grid Layout: Toggleable cell styles, with CSS grid handling board layout.

## Development Goals

  - Deepen React and Next.js familiarity by building an interactive game.
  - Extend and refactor tutorial code for reusability and modularity.
  - Explore bit-shifting and bit-masking for player state management.
  - Apply CSS grid for layout and practice decoupling visual styling from game logic.
  - Keep components lean with a focus on single-responsibility principles.

## Summary

**This project reinforced key React and Next.js concepts, strengthened my understanding of bitwise operations, and enhanced my development setup. It’s also a robust foundation for future grid based games and interactive projects.**
